# Emotion-Aware Chatbot — "Girlfriend-Style" AI

> _"A chatbot that doesn't just answer, but feels."_  

This was my second attempt at building a chatbot—but with a twist. I didn’t want another logic-based Q&A machine. I wanted something **emotionally aware**, a chatbot that could respond with **empathy, affection, or even playful teasing**, based on the user's tone and intent. The goal? To build something that felt **real**, not robotic.

## 💡 Project Vision

Most chatbots follow strict patterns, often ignoring emotional depth. This project aimed to break that mold. Inspired by the concept of emotionally intelligent interactions, I decided to experiment with a **"girlfriend-style" chatbot**—not in a gimmicky way, but as a personality that could show care, understanding, or light humor based on context.

This bot isn’t perfect, but it’s a **raw step toward making NLP more emotionally expressive.**

## 🛠️ What's Inside

- `dataset.json`  
  Custom dataset designed for emotionally contextual conversations.

- `train.py`  
  Script for training the emotion-aware model.

- `tests/`  
  Scripts to test the dataset quality and overfitting checks.

- `model/`  
  Pretrained model and supporting files.

- `accuracy.txt`  
  Logs and training results (current accuracy: **81%**, though with noticeable overfitting).

---

## 🔍 Accuracy & Observations

- **Current Accuracy:** 81%  
- **Known Issue:** The model currently suffers from overfitting.
- **Next Steps:** Continue refining the dataset and explore more advanced NLP architectures (like transformers with emotional embeddings).

## 📌 Why I Built This

This wasn't about achieving perfection. It was about experimenting, failing, learning, and getting closer to something new. I’m uploading this project as a **snapshot of the journey**, not the destination. I will keep pushing, learning, and improving this idea with time.

## 📚 Future Goals

- Reduce overfitting via regularization and better data balancing.
- Explore transformer-based emotional NLP models.
- Introduce multi-turn memory for deeper, more consistent conversations.
- Deploy the chatbot as a lightweight web or mobile app.
